## Introduction to Algebra

Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. It is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics and has applications in virtually every field.

### Variables and Constants

In algebra, we use letters (like $x$, $y$, and $z$) to represent variables â€” quantities that can change or take different values. Constants, on the other hand, are fixed values (like $2$, $\pi$, or $e$).

An algebraic expression combines variables and constants with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Basic Operations

Let's review the basic algebraic operations:

**Addition and Subtraction**:
$x + y$ represents the sum of $x$ and $y$
$x - y$ represents the difference of $x$ and $y$

**Multiplication**:
$x \times y$ or simply $xy$ represents the product of $x$ and $y$

**Division**:
$\frac{x}{y}$ represents $x$ divided by $y$ (where $y \neq 0$)

### Example: Simplifying Expressions

Let's simplify the expression: $3x + 2y - 5x + 7y$

1. Group like terms: $(3x - 5x) + (2y + 7y)$
2. Combine like terms: $-2x + 9y$

### Algebraic Properties

Some important properties to remember:

**Commutative Property**:
$a + b = b + a$
$a \times b = b \times a$

**Associative Property**:
$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
$(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$

**Distributive Property**:
$a(b + c) = ab + ac$

## Practice Problems

Try simplifying these expressions:

1. $4x + 3y - 2x + y$
2. $2(3x - 4) + 5x$
3. $\frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}$ (where $x \neq 2$)

Solutions will be discussed in the next chapter.
