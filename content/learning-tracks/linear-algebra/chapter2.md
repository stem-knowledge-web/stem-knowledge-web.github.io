## Linear Equations

A linear equation is an equation that forms a straight line when plotted on a coordinate plane. In its standard form, a linear equation with one variable can be written as:

$$ax + b = 0$$

Where $a$ and $b$ are constants, and $a \neq 0$.

### The Solution Process

To solve a linear equation:

1. Simplify both sides by combining like terms
2. Use the addition property of equality to isolate variable terms on one side
3. Use the multiplication property of equality to isolate the variable
4. Check your solution by substituting it back into the original equation

### Example: Solving a Simple Equation

Let's solve the equation: $3x - 7 = 8$

1. Add 7 to both sides:
   $3x - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7$
   $3x = 15$

2. Divide both sides by 3:
   $\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}$
   $x = 5$

3. Check: $3(5) - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8$ ✓

### Solving Equations with Variables on Both Sides

Let's solve: $4x - 3 = 2x + 5$

1. Subtract $2x$ from both sides:
   $4x - 2x - 3 = 2x - 2x + 5$
   $2x - 3 = 5$

2. Add 3 to both sides:
   $2x - 3 + 3 = 5 + 3$
   $2x = 8$

3. Divide both sides by 2:
   $\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}$
   $x = 4$

4. Check: $4(4) - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13$ and $2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13$ ✓

## Solutions to Chapter 1 Practice Problems

1. $4x + 3y - 2x + y = 2x + 4y$
2. $2(3x - 4) + 5x = 6x - 8 + 5x = 11x - 8$
3. $\frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} = \frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2} = x + 2$ (where $x \neq 2$)

## Practice Problems

Try solving these equations:

1. $5x + 3 = 18$
2. $7x - 4 = 3x + 12$
3. $2(x + 3) = 3(x - 1) + 4$

Solutions will be discussed in the next chapter.
