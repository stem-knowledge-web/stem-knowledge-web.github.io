## Hello there!

STEM Knowledge is a project that aims to provide well researched, SEO-free, and crisp pedagogical content for learning science subjects. Inspired from projects like [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com), [LibreTexts](https://libretexts.org/), and others.

Started in 2025, this project aims to be like Wikipedia ‚Äì open, community driven, **exhaustive**, and free from SEO (that is aimed only at generating clicks), but a learning resource rather than a reference.

We aim to develop an¬†**up-to-date knowledge base**¬†for pure and applied sciences that can teach anyone anything. Our aim is to be an online ‚Äúsuper-book‚Äù for scientific subjects, by having examples, problems, solutions, etc. but without the constraints of a physical book.

We seek contributions from **professors, researchers, domain experts** etc. who wish to share their expertise and knowledge with everyone. Please visit our¬†[Github](https://github.com/stem-knowledge-web)¬†repository to make contributions.

This resource will always remain free of promotions and advertisements.

Happy learning! üôÇ

## Vision

We envision a future where STEM Knowledge is the goto place for anyone who wishes to learn or teach anything related to science. Our content could be used for online or offline lectures, MOOCs, or even published books!

## Road To An Idea

As a student, whenever I wanted to understand a particular topic in depth, I would, as a reflex, just Google it. A typical search result would contain links to 

| Source | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wikipedia | great source for ***knowing*** | not a great source for ***learning*** |
| Good Research paper | quality content | - high entry barrier <br>- doesn‚Äôt provide incremental knowledge; <br> - behind a paywall |
| Textbooks | finest source of information (personal favourite) | - do not keep up with latest research <br>- too many books on a single topic (decision paralysis) <br> - physical limitations of pages - even in eBooks / PDFs |
| Blogs | - are great if written by an expert | - hard to find <br>- if optimized for SEO, a lot of trash in there; <br>- might not be content wise exhaustive; <br>- might not be mathematically rigorous |
| MOOCs | high quality info | - unjustifiably long videos <br>- too many to choose from (decision paralysis yet again) |

<br>

I am not a publisher. I am not an author. I am not an expert. I enjoy learning. I enjoy those "Aha!" moments. I wish to make STEM Knowledge a central space for people who are like me.
