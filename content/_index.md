### Hi there!

We are a community driven knowledge-base project that aims to provide free and high quality scientific learning materials in a clean, distraction-free environment. Our focus is on the content - making complex subjects accessible through thoughtful organization and clear presentation.

### Our Philosophy

We believe that learning should be:

- **Accessible**: Available to everyone, not behind a paywall
- **Focused**: Free from distractions and unnecessary elements
- **Comprehensive**: Covering topics in appropriate depth and breadth
- **Structured**: Organized in a logical progression to build understanding
- **Community Driven** : We all can benefit by standing on shoulders of giants :)
